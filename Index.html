        <h2 class="activity-title">1. Relaxing at Home</h2>
        <p>I started my vacation by staying home and relaxing. After exams, it was nice to sleep late, watch TV, and spend time with family. I helped with household chores and enjoyed homemade meals.</p>

        <h2 class="activity-title">2. Trip to Amritsar</h2>
        <p>The highlight of my vacation was visiting the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The beautiful gurudwara and the peaceful atmosphere gave me blessings and inner peace. I also enjoyed the langar (community meal) and visited Jallianwala Bagh.</p>

        <h2 class="activity-title">3. Completing School Work</h2>
        <p>I finished my holiday homework early so I could enjoy the rest of my vacation. This helped me stay ahead in studies. I also revised some difficult subjects to prepare for the new academic year.</p>

        <h2 class="activity-title">4. Learning New Skills</h2>
        <p>I used my free time to learn basic HTML (which helped me make this page!). I also practiced drawing and tried some new recipes in the kitchen with my mother's guidance.</p>

    <div class="activity-box">
        <h2 class="activity-title">5. Meeting Friends</h2>
        <p>I met my school friends several times during the vacation. We went to the park, played cricket, and shared stories. It was fun to spend time with them outside of school.</p>

        <p>This summer vacation was both relaxing and productive. I'm ready to start Class 11 with fresh energy!</p>
